A **Signle Developer Framework** for Web Development, for Go developers.

I like the idea of Rails, Laravel and similar frameworks, but I laso love the simplicity of Go.

I want to see how ard it is to build one of these frameworks, especially now
where a no-build JS stack is possible. (Thanks DHH for the talk!)
